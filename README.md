The task was to study the dataset and independently perform the formulation of the analysis problem and its implementation using the Python programming language.
The dataset contains data on the consumption of alcoholic beverages: wine, beer, vodka, champagne and brandy in all regions of the Russian Federation from 1998 to 2016 per capita.
After preparing and cleaning the dataset, I decided to perform a cluster analysis of the regions by the dynamics and structure of alcohol consumption. Hierarchical clustering was applied with the construction of a dendrogram of regions. We identified 4 clusters of regions according to the nature and dynamics of consumption. The differences and overlaps in alcohol consumption in the regions of different clusters were analyzed and a technical and presentation report was drawn up for certification.
As a result, I received a certificate confirming that I have all the necessary knowledge and skills to work as a Data Scientist.
